# Simple Marginal Tax Illustration

A simple site to illustrate how marginal taxes work, particularly in regards to how the actual tax rate increases as income does.


## Get started

Run dev mode with:
```bash
yarn dev
```

By default, the server will only respond to requests from localhost. To allow connections from other computers, edit the `sirv` commands in package.json to include the option `--host 0.0.0.0`.

## Building and running in production mode

To create an optimised version of the app:

```bash
yarn build
```

You can run the newly built app with `yarn start`. This uses [sirv](https://github.com/lukeed/sirv), which is included in your package.json's `dependencies` so that the app will work when you deploy to platforms like [Heroku](https://heroku.com).
